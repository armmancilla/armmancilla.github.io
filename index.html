            <p>
                During the COVID-19 pandemic, daily infection cases were processed and reported through public
                databases by CONACYT. For privacy reasons, I cannot disclose all the details about the Epidemic
                Models we implemented. However, I can provide an overview of some of the preparations required for
                the later analysis, including the data cleaning process and infected waves identification.
                <br><br>
                This project was developed completely in Jupyter Notebook (Python), reading and processing the data
                using <i>Pandas</i> and <i>Numpy</i> libraries. The analysis and model implementation was done using the
                <i>Scipy</i> library, and the visualization was done using <i>Matplotlib</i>.

            <h2 id="p1:national">National Waves</h2>
            <hr style="height:0; margin-top:5px; border: 0.15px solid #d9d9d9">

            <p>
                We can study the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico from the perspective of individual infection waves.
                The data was obtained from a CONACYT CSV database, including national and state data. This raw data
                includes details that difficult its read and process, given that it was provided by multiple medical
                institutions. One of the main problems we found is on weekends, where the values tend to be lower due to
                these places working with reduced capacities. For this, I proposed a plan for the cleaning, understanding
                the causes for the anomalies, and created a function that helps us automate this process for this
                particular database.

                <ol type="I" style="font-size:17px;">
                    <li style="padding-bottom:10px">
                        <b>ANOMALY CRITERIA:</b> Starting from an initial average of the data, we must give a tolerance
                        factor that once multiplied by this average can be able to segregate anomalies from desired values,
                        this has to be manually tweaked. After finding an anomaly, we replace its value with the average of
                        the 6 surrounding neighbors, we choose this number to make it weekly averaged.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom:10px">
                        <b>FINAL SMOOTHING:</b> Once the data is cleaned, we can average the values two more times to
                        reduce the fluctuations and smooth them even more, while keeping the reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom:10px">
                        <b>DERIVATIVE FOR COMPARISON:</b> Showing a curve that appears to be clean does not offer much
                        information about the advantages of using raw quantities. Since many of the models we will be
                        working with rely on the derivative, we can see both the fluctuations of each data
                        set and if we can use it to apply our models. Instead of applying the derivative to consecutive
                        days, we set a window of 3 days, equivalent to half-week to reduce the noise of the raw data.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                With the cleaned data, we can start the identification of the specific waves in the pandemic. This
                process has to be done manually but, thanks to the derivative, we can make it easier by identifying the
                places where the derivative is zero, some of which will correspond to the peaks of the waves. And after
                delimiting the times where we measure each wave, and displaying the defunctions, we can get a more
                complete picture of our phenomenon.

            <p>
                The same method can be applied to the state data, but by doing so, we have to consider that the
                number of cases is much lower than the national data. This means that the fluctuations are more
                pronounced and the anomalies are harder to detect. We can use the same criteria as before, but we have
                to be careful with the tolerance factor, since it can lead to difficulties in the model application.
                In this case, we will focus exclusively on the state data of the most populous regions in Mexico.

                In this project, we study the Random Walk (defined simply as a succession of random steps) in a discrete 
                lattice, through the distribution of <b>final positions</b> (its <span class="inline-eq"><i>x</i></span>
                position at a time <span class="inline-eq"><i>t</i></span>), or the distribution of the <b>visits</b>
                (all the positions in its path), as well as the statistical properties of these distribution: variance,
                skewness, kurtosis. We consider, aside from the simple random walk, two models:

                <ul style="font-size: 16px;">
                    <li>
                        <b>Resetting:</b> Walkers can be relocated to their initial position with some probability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Memory:</b> Walkers can be placed in one of the positions they visited previously.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                For a better performance, I designed all the simulation for the different cases of random walks in <b>Fortran</b>, using
                the <i>OMP Library</i>, measuring the distribution of various walker realizations and the statistical
                properties we will later analyze. The results are then processed and displayed in a <i>Jupyter Notebook</i>.
                Here, I plan to show the results of the simulations, as well as some of the theoretical background (a lot
                of text!).

                The <b>Random Walk</b> is a widespread concept, pilar in many topics related to stochastic processes.
                It consists of a series of random steps or decisions, and based on it, there are multiple ways in
                which we can create diversified dynamics.
                <br> <br>
                This project was thought to serve as the fundaments to understand Random Walk theory and codding, to
                ease the later development of models based on random walkers. This section assembles the results
                provided by the Fortran codes simulations, as well as giving some analytical background.

            <p>
                The results of this project are based mainly on Probability Density Functions (PDFs), and on the
                analysis of the statistical moments, unique properties of each distribution. There are a few concepts
                we need to discuss to get a better understanding of the following sections. We can define the <i>raw
                moments</i> of any variable <span class="inline-eq"><i>z</i></span> as
            </p>
            <img class="equation" src="images/projects/equations/eq1.svg">
            <p>
                Properties such as the variance, skewness and kurtosis are statistical moments calculated from the
                raw moments.
            </p>
            <img class="equation" src="images/projects/equations/eq2.svg">
            <p>
                And the same goes for the following moments. In combination with these two, as long as we have an
                analytical PDF, we can try to calculate the statistical moments as well.
                <br><br>
                Inside the simulation, we have to consider discrete quantities, and the numerical calculation of raw
                moments obeys the following formula:
            </p>
            <img class="equation" src="images/projects/equations/eq3.svg">
            <p>
                It is obvious to notice that this is just an average over the number of realizations
                <span class="inline-eq">m</span>. In our simulations, <span class="inline-eq">z</span> corresponds to
                the final positions.
                <br><br>
                We should discuss a little more about the meaning of the statistical moments. These are quantities that
                showcase certain aspects of a Probability Distribution, we can even think of them as customized
                identifiers. The first one, the mean value, <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>1</sub></span>, represents
                a point that indicates the central tendency of the data, for symmetrical distributions, this lies on their
                axis of symmetry. In the context of Random Walks, this is usually <span class="inline-eq">0</span>. The
                next one is the variance, <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>2</sub></span>, indicating how far the data
                is scattered around the mean. In this topic, it can actually give us information about the final positions
                that walkers can reach, and what kind of dynamics their paths will follow. The third moment is pretty
                straightforward, it is called skewness, <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>3</sub></span>, and its value
                measures the symmetry of a distribution, if <span class="inline-eq">0</span>, the distribution is
                symmetric, if negative, it is skewed to the left, and if positive, it is skewed to the right. Finally,
                the fourth moment, the kurtosis, <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>4</sub></span>, refers to the form of
                the distribution, specifically the form of its tails. The higher the kurtosis, the wider the tails, and
                for lower values the majority of the data is concentrated around the mean, with small tails. For reference,
                the kurtosis of the normal distribution is <span class="inline-eq">3</span>.

            <div class="images caption">Illustrative diagram
            about the effects of statistical moments on a distribution.</div>

            <p>
                There is a technical aspect that we have to consider to measure a distribution of random walker's
                positions, this is the possible final positions. To have a better idea, let's think about a random walk
                with <span class="inline-eq">3</span> steps starting from <span class="inline-eq">0</span>: the first step,
                the walker can only be at <span class="inline-eq">-1</span> or <span class="inline-eq">+1</span>, zero
                is not part of these options. In the second step, the walker can be at <span class="inline-eq">-2,0,+2
                </span>, and we are starting to notice a pattern. In the final step, the trend is more visible, since the
                possible final positions of the walker are <span class="inline-eq">-3,-1,+1,+3</span>. Therefore, we see
                that the final position of the walker, in a discrete lattice, is dependent on the number of steps being
                odd or even, and a distribution measure under these circumstances would have gaps, depending on the number
                of steps. To counter this effect, at the final time, where we intend to measure the final positions, we
                only update half of the walkers, so that half of the final positions are odd and half are even numbers.

            <p>
                Before diving into the theory behind random walks, I want to briefly discuss the most general details
                about these processes. Starting from the <i>simple</i> case of the <b>random walk</b>. We can define it
                just as a sequence of random steps, and visualize it by the sum of all the steps, let us name it
                <span class="inline-eq"><i>X</i></span>:
            </p>
            <img class="equation" src="images/projects/equations/eq4.svg">
            <p>
                And, of course, the final value for <span class="inline-eq"><i>X</i></span> depends on the number of steps
                <span class="inline-eq"><i>n</i></span>.
                <br><br>
                To make it easier to understand and study, these random steps can only be either <span class="inline-eq">
                +1</span> or <span class="inline-eq">-1</span>, both of them chosen with a
                probability of <span class="inline-eq">1/2</span>. This can be thought of as a walker that can go
                up or down.
            </p>
            <img class="images" style="max-width: 500px;" src="images/projects/project2/individual_simple.png">
            <div class="images caption">Individual simple random walk.</div>
            <p>
                If instead of two choices (<span class="inline-eq">+1,-1</span>), we could make the walker return
                to the start, <span class="inline-eq"><i>X<sub>0</sub></i></span>, with a probability
                <span class="inline-eq"><i>&gamma; =</i> 1/10</span>, that is, made it reset about every
                <span class="inline-eq">10</span> steps, then we would have what we called the random walk with
                <b>resetting</b>. Later on, we will see how this affects the simple walk dynamics, but I can tell you
                now that it will keep it closer to this position <span class="inline-eq"><i>X<sub>0</sub></i></span>.

            <div class="images caption">Individual random walk with resetting.</div>
            <p>
                Now, if the relocation of the walker is done not to its initial position, but instead to one of the
                positions it has previously visited, we are allowing our walker to have <b>memory</b>. With this, the
                places it visits the most have more chances of being chosen when it jumps. This dynamic is implemented
                with a probability <span class="inline-eq"><i>&gamma;</i></span>.
                <br><br>
                To visualize this, we do a random walk simulation with memory before actually showing it, so the walker
                we display has an existing distribution of visits beforehand.

                In both discrete time and space, such as we saw in the <a href="#p2:individual">Individual Random Walks</a>,
                the probability of finding the walker in the position
                <span class="inline-eq"><i>x</i></span> at a given step <span class="inline-eq"><i>n</i></span> is

                However, we aim to study the random walk behavior in the continuous regime, for this, we need to consider the
                finite differences approximations to obtain a Partial Differential Equation:

                unsurprisingly for diffusive particles as one can think random walkers to be.

            <p>
                The solution to the Diffusion equation is obtained by doing a variable change, using the Fourier
                transform: <span class="inline-eq" style="text-decoration: overline;"><i>P</i></span><span class="inline-eq">
                <i>(k,t) = &int; P(x,t)</i> exp<i>(-ikx)</i> d<i>x</i></span>. The result is a Gaussian function:

            <p>
                Here, we get some early results by comparing this to the normal distribution, for instance, the mean value
                is <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>1</sub><i> = x<sub>0</sub></i></span> (<span class="inline-eq">0</span>
                in our case), and the variance is <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>2</sub><i> = 2Dt</i></span>. In the
                results, this function is a distribution of <b>Final Positions</b>, that is, the position where a walker
                can be found after a time <span class="inline-eq"><i>t</i></span>.

                The rest of the statistical properties can be calculated from this function. Not surprisingly, for a
                symmetrical distribution, the skewness results in <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>3</sub><i> = </i>0</span>,
                and the kurtosis is that of the Gaussian Distribution, <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>4</sub><i> = </i>3</span>.

                All the simulation results follow a similar behavior to a Gaussian, only differing from each other
                in the variance which increases linearly with time. Nevertheless, the statistical moments measured at
                equal times are the same. As we mentioned before, the kurtosis clearly indicates a distribution close to
                a Gaussian.

            <p>
                There is another type of distribution that collects all the information about the walkers' path.
                Instead of looking solely at the final positions, we can keep track of the visits the walkers pay to the
                positions. In a mathematical sense, this is similar to stacking all the distributions of final positions
                for different times, up to the time <span class="inline-eq"><i>t</i></span>.

                the values of the statistical moments are not so intuitive, but they can be calculated with the PDF.
                The variance is just half of what we expect for the final positions,
                <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>2</sub><i> = Dt</i></span>. The kurtosis now has a value of
                <span class="inline-eq">&Mu;<sub>4</sub><i> = </i>4</span>, meaning more values are concentrated around
                the mean, naturally for the measurement of visits.
                <br><br>
                There is a change in how we measure the statistical moments, related to the normalization. When we only
                count the final positions of the walkers, to average the moments we just divide over the number of
                realizations <span class="inline-eq"><i>m</i></span> 
                (<a href="#p2:introduction">Introduction</a>). However, by taking into account all the

                In the resetting case, a random walker not only hops to neighbor positions, but it has a probability

                <span class="inline-eq"><i>x<sub>0</sub></i></span>. This limits the diffusion of the walker, that is

                new terms that implement the resetting. When a walker is reset, with probability <span class="inline-eq">
                <i>&gamma;</i></span>, the PDF loses a flux of probability in the position <span class="inline-eq"><i>x</i>
                </span> that gets added to the initial position of the walker <span class="inline-eq"><i>x<sub>0</sub></i>
                </span>, represented as a <span class="inline-eq"><i>&delta;</i></span> function (Evans M. & Majumdar S.,
                2011).

                In this case, the diffusion constant <span class="inline-eq"><i>D</i></span>, is not the same as for the
                simple random walk. Empirically, we found that <span class="inline-eq"><i>D = (1 - &gamma;)/2</i></span>.

                This can be reduced to a stationary equation that becomes a non-homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equation.

                The resetting is one of the most remarkable models of the random walk. The variance indicates the
                existent difficulty to reach new positions, and we could even think walkers are caged inside a specific

                Something interesting happens when we try to find the PDF for the visits. If we use our stationary
                solution we get the same result, as its independence of time yields <span class="inline-eq"><i>t</i></span>
                as both the result of the integral and the normalization constant, thus nullifying. And the simulations
                suggest there is not a big change in the dynamics.

                By looking at the distribution and the statistical properties, we can see that this case is close to
                time-independent. Why "close"? The small amount of data in the final positions, in comparison with the
                visits, gives us a variance result that might not show the full picture. Here, the kurtosis and the PDF
                are the same as before, but there is a difference in the variance produced by a better resolution of data.
                This new perspective indicates an asymptotic behavior that tends to the value we calculated theoretically
                using the stationary solution, but the stochastic effects on the resetting dynamics, that is, the
                probability of resetting, allows walkers to get to new positions with enough time.

                This case also allows walkers' relocation besides the normal step, but instead of placing the walker in a
                defined position, this is chosen according to a probability distribution of all the visited sites up to
                that point. Meaning that the walker has memory of the places it has been to.

                this is added into a term that represents the visits distribution instead of a single position

                We cannot get an analytical expression for the PDF, nevertheless, we can turn the last equation incognita
                into the second moment, only time-dependent. This is done by applying the definition of the statistical
                moments we discussed at the beginning of this document in the
                <a href=#p2:introduction>Introduction</a> section; after which we apply a time derivative

                The Metropolis algorithm is a Monte Carlo method used to sample from a probability distribution. Unlike the
                Monte Carlo method, the change in the state of the system allows us to have more resolution due to the
                distribution samples. The algorithm is based on the idea of accepting or rejecting a new state based on the
                energy difference between the current and new state. As a result, for systems with a large number of
                particles, the Metropolis algorithm is a powerful tool for simulating thermodynamic systems with a more
                flexible particle size.

                This project is still a work in progress, but some features are polished enough. The annihilation is a
                process that occurs when two random walkers are removed from the system when they encounter each other.
                We use a ring configuration of discrete nodes to easily measure the concentration of the walkers at any
                time (<span class="inline-eq"><i>#walkers/#nodes</i></span>). There are two ways in which we can update
                the position of the walkers, and they will shape the behavior of the results:
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size:17px;">
                <li>
                    <b>Asynchronous:</b> Also known as the MonteCarlo method. We randomly select one of the nodes, and
                    if there is a walker on it, update its position; the annihilation takes place if another walker is
                    found at the new position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Synchronous:</b> All walkers' positions are updated simultaneously, and the annihilation depends
                    on the final configuration of particles, performed only after all walkers have moved.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                We study the evolution of the concentration variable, measured every MonteCarlo Step (MCS), that is,
                after <span class="inline-eq"><i>n</i></span> iterations, with <span class="inline-eq"><i>n</i></span>
                being the number of nodes. We can look at other variables as the distribution of the nearest neighbor
                distance, which is defined as the number of nodes that separates two contiguous walkers.
                <br><br>
                The simulation is done in a 1D ring, as a lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The walkers are placed randomly
                on the nodes, and the annihilation is done when two walkers are on the same node. The simulations are
                developed in <b>Fortran</b>, using the <i>OMP Library</i>, and the results are shown in a <i>Jupyter
                Notebook</i>.

            <p>
                The type of update we choose to change the walkers' positions is important, as it will affect the
                behavior of the concentration. To understand this, let's discuss the two cases separately. For starters,
                in the Asynchronous update, we select a node randomly, and if there is a walker on it, we update its
                position, and if there is another walker on the new position, we remove both of them. This means that the
                annihilation only depends on one walker's movement. We repeat this process a number of
                <span class="inline-eq"><i>n</i></span> (number of nodes) times to complete one MonteCarlo Step (MCS).
                Now, the Synchronous update is a little bit more complex, and it is worth showing a diagram to explain it:
            </p>

            <img class="images" style="max-width: 150px;" src="images/projects/project4/synchronous.svg">
            <div class="images caption">Synchronous update possible scenarios.</div>

            <p>
                In the synchronous update, we go node by node, and if there is a walker on it, we have different situations.
                In the first scenario, there is no walker in the new position, so we just move it. In the second case,
                there is a walker on the new position, and we have to check the following conditions (3-5). As we have a
                1D ring, the walkers cannot interchange positions, and if they move in opposite directions, they will be
                annihilated. If both move in the same direction and they don't encounter a third walker, they will survive.
                And, finally, if instead there does exist a third walker, the first one will survive, and we have to check
                the conditions again for the last pair.
            </p>

            <p>
                The results of the simulations for large systems, with 4,000 nodes and 2,000 walkers (50% of initial
                occupancy), are shown below.

            <p>
                At the beginning, the concentration decay differs for both cases, probably due to the extra diffusion
                provided by the random selection of the nodes in the Asynchronous update. We can get a better insight of
                the behavior of the concentration by looking at the distribution of the nearest neighbor distance. This
                is defined as the number of nodes that separates two contiguous walkers. The distribution is shown below:

            <div class="images caption">Nearest Neighbor distributions for Asynchronous and Synchronous updates.</div>

            <p>
                At a time like <span class="inline-eq"><i>t = </i>10 MCS</span>, we can see that the Synchronous update
                has a higher probability of having a walker close to another one, as the distribution is shifted to the
                left. This would indicate lower annihilation rates, in contrast to the Asynchronous update, however, after
                a few more MCS, both distributions follow the same trend.
